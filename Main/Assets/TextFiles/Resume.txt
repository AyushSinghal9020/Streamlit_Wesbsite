Projects
VALrind(work in porgress) (Python-Numpy)
• Made a Python Library for training Neural Networks. Used a different approach for Matrix Multiplication.
Integrated different types of Bivariate Functions
• Reduced Time-Complexity to O(n). Trained BERT on single CPU from scratch. Decreased Neural Evolution
Time-Complexity to O(logn)
• Enabled Graph Neural network creation, visualization and training
Vdev(work in progress) (Python)
• Made a Python Library to connect different languages inside Python Environment. Decreased Computation Time
• Removed the dependency of DLL Files
Ethereum Price Prediction (Python - Pytorch Lightning)
• Implemented Ethereum price prediction using Pytorch LSTMs in Python with Pytorch Lightning.
• Achieved close to 0 RMSE loss, highlighting the model’s accuracy in forecasting.
• Demonstrated the effectiveness of the chosen methodology for Ethereum price prediction.
Student Assesment Evaluation (Python - Pytorch, HuggingFace, WandB)
• Applied RoBERTa, PyTorch, HuggingFace, and WandB to predict student assessment scores with a focus on
wording and content.
• Achieved an 83 Percent accuracy in evaluating student assessments, highlighting the model’s effectiveness.
• Integrated Python and a comprehensive tech stack for a robust system to analyze and predict student performance.
